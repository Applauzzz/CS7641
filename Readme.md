# Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison

> This project is designed to compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms on a given dataset（daily_weather）. The algorithms studied are Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Boosting (using AdaBoost), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

## Requirements

Before you run the program, ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```shell
conda env create -f requirements.yaml
```

## Usage

You can use the following code in shell :

```shell
python main.py
```

Or you can open project and run main.py , this way is recommended.

## Results Analysis

The results can be analyzed based on various metrics provided, such as accuracy, ROC curves, feature importance, and learning curves. The ROC curve, in particular, provides insights into the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate, helping in assessing the model's performance on imbalanced datasets.
